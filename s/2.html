I take one thing on faith: that <span class="gold">Joy</span> is good. Not just my own, but that every thinking thing - human or not, present and future. Diel enlightened me to this eternal truth and still acts as its guiding light in my life.
<br><br>
The day we met, Diel woke under the morning light shining down on a dying planet. But he didn't know that yet. His eyes were still closed. The first thing he would see once he opens them would be me looking down at him.
<br><br>
I had arrived at the station an hour before the first train of the day, hoping to find the platform empty.  Instead I found him sleeping on one of the stone slabs.
<br><br>
I sat down next to him.  With a stranger here I couldn't go forwards with my original plans, and was no longer sure I wanted to.  I leaned over, looking down at his face.  The horn of a freight train blared as it blew by the station.  We locked eyes.
<br><br>
I shrunk back, embarrassed, but Diel was not so easily dissuaded.  He pushed forward a large calloused hand and introduced himself. I began to apologize for how creepy I'd been, but Diel simply waved it off.
<br><br>
"Don't worry about it.  I get it.  You see a mysterious man in the night. Curiosity takes the better of you, and just like that. Bam. Fate strikes like lightning. A tale as old as time."
<br><br>
"I..." I didn't know what to say.
<br><br>
He looked up at the sky.  The sunrise bathed distant skyscrapers blood red. Finally he spoke again. "Looks like rain."
<br><br>
I couldn't see a single cloud in the sky and it had not rained in months. I thought of my coworkers still back in their warm hotel rooms without a care in the world.
<br><br>
"I hope not."
<br><br>
He looked over and examined me, then asked why I was here so early in the morning. Not that he was one to speak. I told him a half truth, that I'd been on a corporate retreat, and it had been fun, but now it was time to head home.
<br><br>
"That doesn't answer my question."
<br><br>
I considered it. "No, I suppose not.  Lots of reasons. Most of it boils down to reducing my environmental footprint. Trains are better than planes, but buses tend to be late."
<br><br>
He nodded knowingly.
<br><br>
We kept on talking and soon I found myself spilling my entire life story to him. It was a dynamic I knew well. Often I had had perfect strangers on long distance greyhounds monologue about every excruciating detail of their lives. But it had never been me doing the telling.
