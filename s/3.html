When Rock joined us, I had wanted to detour back to civilization, but Diel was blinded by the allure of the peak. I tried to get Trea on my side, but it was a lost cause. They had done the math, and even with an extra mouth to feed, we had enough supplies to last us the two day journey to the top and back.
<br><br>
At first it wasn't too bad. It had been unusually cold for the season, but the sky had been clear. Then, during around sundown of the second day, winds blew in thick clouds.
<br><br>
Diel and I were sharing a tent when the snow started. It was already nearly midnight, but we had stayed up playing cards.
<br><br>
The snow had not stopped the next morning. If anything it had gotten worse.
